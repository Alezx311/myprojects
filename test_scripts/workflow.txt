OSEM by @uduk
A computer generated melody project, optionally users can plug-in their guitar and/or MIDI key controller to dictate input harmonic. Meyda.js is being used to extract audio signal features, such as beat dynamic and music segmentation in order to help OSEM to produce high-quality music melody. It is meant to answer the question: “Given an arbitrary backing track (format: wav, mp3) can computer compose?”
